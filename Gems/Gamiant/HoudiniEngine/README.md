# HoudiniEngine

This Gem enables the use of [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini) with [O3DE](http://www.o3de.org).

When this gem is enabled in an O3DE project, a menu item named "Houdini" will appear on O3DE's main menu as well as a toolbar that provides shortcuts to some of the most frequently used features.

The first step in using Houdini in O3DE is to open a Houdini Session.

If Houdini is not already running, select "Open Houdini Session Sync" from the Houdini Configuration panel. If Houdini is already running, make sure to enable Houdini Engine, then in O3DE select "Start Session".
